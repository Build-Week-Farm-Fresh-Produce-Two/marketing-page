**About**

Farmers throw away tons of produce and lose their money since they are not able to sell their whole produce inventory to local markets. Farmfresh app is a step to help those farmers by creating a web app that links up farmers with those excited to consume delicious, fresh, organic and locally sourced produce. This web app platform will help the farmers to connect with a broder customer base.

This repository represents the marketing page to show our vision and selling pitch.
